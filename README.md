## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

This project contains an exploratory data analysis notebook on the classic Iris dataset.

- **Author:** Blessing  
- **Purpose:** Perform exploratory data analysis using pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib.  
- **Date:** May 2025

The notebook `eda_iris_blessing.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Loading and inspecting the Iris dataset from seaborn’s built-in datasets
- Performing initial data inspection to check data types, missing values, and dataset shape
- Computing summary statistics to understand numerical feature distributions
- Visualizing data distributions with histograms and count plots for categorical variables
- Creating new features (e.g., Sepal Area) for enhanced analysis and feature engineering
- Exploring relationships between features through pair plots and scatter plots, highlighting species-specific patterns
- Summarizing key insights about species differentiation based on petal and sepal measurements
- Providing clear markdown annotations and structured sections for easy understanding and reproducibility

To run the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies installed and use a Jupyter environment.

# Module 4: Jupyter and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project focuses on learning and applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebooks. The main dataset used is the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for data analysis and classification.

## Objectives

- Practice using Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization  
- Perform descriptive statistics and visual EDA on the Iris dataset  
- Learn how to interpret summary statistics and graphical plots  
- Develop an understanding of key EDA techniques to prepare for predictive modeling  

## What Was Done

- Loaded the Iris dataset using seaborn’s built-in datasets  
- Performed initial descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset  
- Created visualizations including pair plots, histograms, count plots, and scatter plots to explore feature distributions and relationships  
- Engineered a new feature, Sepal Area, to enhance feature analysis  
- Analyzed key patterns such as species differentiation based on petal and sepal measurements  
- Provided detailed markdown annotations to explain each step and section  
- Summarized findings with initial insights and outlined next steps for predictive modeling and further exploration  

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `eda_iris_blessing.ipynb`.  
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.  
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt` for dependencies).

## Next Steps

- Build classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict Iris species.  
- Explore feature importance and correlations in greater depth.  
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for visualization and noise reduction.  
- Practice EDA techniques on other datasets to strengthen analytical skills.
