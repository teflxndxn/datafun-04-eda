# datafun-04-eda
## Project Initialization

This project was initialized following the professional standards for data analytics projects:

- Created a new GitHub repository named `datafun-04-eda` with a default `README.md`.
- Cloned the repository locally to the development machine.
- Added common project files including `.gitignore` and `requirements.txt`.
- Committed and pushed the initial files to GitHub.
- Set up a local Python virtual environment to manage dependencies.
- Ready for Jupyter Notebook development.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Iris Dataset

This project contains an exploratory data analysis notebook on the classic Iris dataset.

- **Author:** Blessing
- **Purpose:** Perform exploratory data analysis using pandas, Seaborn, and matplotlib.
- **Date:** May 2025

The notebook `eda_iris_blessing.ipynb` demonstrates:
- Loading and inspecting the Iris dataset
- Basic summary statistics and data cleaning
- Visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and count plots
- Insights from the data distributions and relationships between features

To run the notebook, ensure you have the required dependencies installed and use a Jupyter environment.

# Module 4: Jupyter and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview

This project focuses on learning and applying Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Jupyter Notebooks. The main dataset used is the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for data analysis and classification.

## Objectives

- Practice using Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization.
- Perform descriptive statistics and visual EDA on the Iris dataset.
- Learn how to interpret summary statistics and graphical plots.
- Develop an understanding of key EDA techniques to prepare for predictive modeling.

## What Was Done

- Loaded the Iris dataset using seabornâ€™s built-in datasets.
- Performed initial descriptive statistics to summarize the dataset.
- Created visualizations including pair plots, histograms, and boxplots to explore feature distributions and relationships.
- Analyzed key patterns such as species differentiation based on petal and sepal measurements.
- Summarized findings and outlined next steps for predictive modeling and further exploration.

## How to Run

1. Open the Jupyter notebook `bless_jupyter_eda.ipynb`.
2. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.
3. Ensure required libraries are installed (see `requirements.txt`).

## Next Steps

- Build classification models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees) to predict Iris species.
- Explore feature importance and correlations.
- Apply dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- Practice EDA on other datasets.
